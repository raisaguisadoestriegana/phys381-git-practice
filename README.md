In my proyect I'm going to talk about how radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays) to kill cancer cells. I will use Beer-Lambert Law to simulate how radiation dose falls off with depth inside tissue.

I cloned the repo [computational-physics-python](https://github.com/konstgav/computational-physics-python).  
It contains Jupyter notebooks that talk about computational physics concepts.
The language used to write the notebook is not English, but I could see multiple graphs that simulate the motion of a pendulum.
